            "text": "One work by this author uses printing, gunpowder, and the compass as symbols of personal ambition, national ambition, and the ambition of the human race to extend its grasp. This thinker described three forms of false learning as \"delicate\", \"contentious\", and \"fantastical\" in categorizing the \"distempers\" that impede academic progress. This thinker imagined a utopian university called Salomon's House, and he likened received systems of philosophy to stage plays that misrepresent the world, and thus labeled them \"idols of the theatre\". This author of The New Atlantis established the doctrine of inductive, empirical methodology. For 10 points, name this 17th-century English philosopher who wrote Novum Organum and spearheaded the Scientific Revolution."

In one scene in this play, a man misses while trying to slap his impudent maid, who keeps interrupting him to protest his plans to marry off his daughter against her will. By hiding in a closet, Damis overhears the title character of this play attempt to seduce Elmire, the wife of his host. The title character plans to use Argas' casket full of incriminating documents to blackmail the brother of Cl\u00e9ante, until a messenger from Louis XIV arrives to have him arrested instead. For 10 points, name this play in which Orgon's family hosts the title religious hypocrite, a play by Moli\u00e8re."

            "text": "Calculating a Racah W-coefficient requires knowledge of six parameters corresponding to this quantity. Another set of coefficients arising from this quantity relate reduced matrix elements to the spherical tensor. The individual components of the operator corresponding to this quantity commute with its square, but not with each other. That square of the operator corresponding to this quantity has as its eigenfunctions the spherical harmonics. This quantity's conservation follows by Noether's theorem from rotational invariance, and implies Kepler's second law. In the case of a particle undergoing uniform circular motion, this quantity's magnitude equals m times v times r. For 10 points, name this quantity, equal to moment of inertia times angular velocity."
