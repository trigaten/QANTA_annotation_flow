  "text": "One character in this play ignores news of his wife's fever, while repeating the line \"Poor fellow!\" in response to reports of the gluttony of a character who drank four beakers of port. In one scene in this play, a man misses while trying to slap his impudent maid, who keeps interrupting him to protest his plans to marry off his daughter against her will. By hiding in a closet, Damis overhears the title character of this play attempt to seduce Elmire, the wife of his host. The title character plans to use Argas' casket full of incriminating documents to blackmail the brother of Cl\u00e9ante, until a messenger from Louis XIV arrives to have him arrested instead. For 10 points, name this play in which Orgon's family hosts the title religious hypocrite, a play by Moli\u00e8re."
