  "text": "One work by this author uses printing, gunpowder, and the compass as symbols of personal ambition, national ambition, and the ambition of the human race to extend its grasp. This thinker described three forms of false learning as \"delicate\", \"contentious\", and \"fantastical\" in categorizing the \"distempers\" that impede academic progress. This thinker imagined a utopian university called Salomon's House, and he likened received systems of philosophy to stage plays that misrepresent the world, and thus labeled them \"idols of the theatre\". This author of The New Atlantis established the doctrine of inductive, empirical methodology. For 10 points, name this 17th-century English philosopher who wrote Novum Organum and spearheaded the Scientific Revolution."
